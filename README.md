## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This repository contains all components required to run the Reddomi MVP.

## No Reddit API required for the MVP

The fastest path to a working test is the cookie-based Reddit DM login flow.

- Use the Cookie Integration screen in the portal to connect a Reddit account with browser cookies.
- This path works without official Reddit app credentials or API client secrets.
- The implementation is in `backend/browser_automation/reddit.go`.

For the launch checklist and readiness notes, see [docs/MVP_READY.md](docs/MVP_READY.md).

```

### Backend Services

- **Portal** — API layer for frontend over gRPC/Connect-Web
- **Spooler** — Tracks relevant posts based on subreddit/keyword pairs every 24h
    - Configurable fanout limits, polling intervals, and daily quotas
    - Limits no of posts to track
    - Limits Max no of relevant posts per day as per the subscribed plan
    - Built-in retry logic for failed posts
    - Send scheduled posts, DM and Comments

### LLM Layer

- Powered by **LiteLLM** (deployed separately)
- Supports **OpenAI** and **Gemini** APIs interchangeably
- Handles scoring, comment/DM generation, and keyword/subreddit suggestions

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Backend**

- Go `1.23+`
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Docker
- LiteLLM
- Playwright

**Frontend**

- Node.js `20+`
- PNPM
- Next.js / React
- Tailwind CSS / Material UI

**Auth & APIs**

- Auth0 (passwordless login)
- Resend (emails)
- Browserless / Steel.dev (CDP automation)
- DODO Payments (subscriptions)

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed:

- Docker
- Go `1.23+`
- Node.js `20+`
- PNPM
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/) for environment variables

---

### Configuration

Start local PostgreSQL and Redis:

```bash
./devel/up.sh
```

Copy the environment file and configure:

```bash
cp .envrc.example .envrc
```

Edit `.envrc` and fill in any required API keys and secrets.

Important: for Reddit account connect, the portal now prefers Steel.dev browser automation. Set `DOOTA_START_COMMON_STEEL_API_KEY` in `.envrc` and provide a valid Steel API key.

If you also set `DOOTA_START_COMMON_BROWSERLESS_API_KEY`, Browserless will be configured as a fallback only. Browserless hobby/free plans may reject Live URL sessions, so Steel is required for the Reddit connect flow.

If you have `direnv` installed, run:

```bash
direnv allow
```

If you do not have `direnv` installed, load the file directly:

```bash
source .envrc
```

Replace placeholders (`<value>`) with your actual secrets and keys.

---

### Quick Start

If you are starting from a fresh machine, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rekhanileshsharma-boop/Reddomi.git
cd Reddomi
cp .envrc.example .envrc
# edit .envrc and fill in required values
# if direnv is installed
# direnv allow
# otherwise
source .envrc

docker compose up -d postgres redis

cd backend
go test ./...
cd ../frontend
pnpm install
cd ../

./run-local.sh
```

This will start the backend on `http://127.0.0.1:8787` and the frontend on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

---

### Backend Setup

Run tests and start the backend:

```bash
cd backend
go test ./...
go build -o redora && ./redora start
```

Initialize the database:

```bash
./backend/script/migrate.sh up
```

Create a new migration:

```bash
./backend/script/migrate.sh new <migration_name>
```

---

### Frontend Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev:portal
```

Visit: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🚀 MVP launch checklist

The current repo is ready for a lean MVP launch path when the following are in place:

1. Valid Reddit integration credentials or browser/cookie automation flow
2. Working OpenAI/LiteLLM key for DM/comment generation
3. Auth0 + portal config for real user sign-in
4. Billing/trial flow stubbed for the first customer demo
5. Clean Reddomi branding and onboarding copy

Use this repo as the launch foundation for Reddomi, then upgrade only the features that customers actually ask for.

---

### Running the Project

You’ll need three components running:

1. **Docker** — for Postgres, Redis, Pub/Sub emulator
   ```bash
   ./devel/up.sh
   ```
2. **Backend** — use [reflex](https://github.com/cespare/reflex) for live reload
   ```bash
   reflex -c .reflex
   ```
3. **Frontend** — Next.js app
   ```bash
   cd frontend && pnpm dev:portal
   ```

Visit:

- `http://localhost:8081` - pgweb (Postgres UI)
- `http://localhost:3000` - Reddomi Portal

---

## Exact working startup (tested)

1. Copy example environment values:

```bash
cp .envrc.example .envrc
```

2. Load environment variables:

```bash
direnv allow
```

3. Start local dependencies:

```bash
./devel/up.sh
```

4. Start the app using the built-in startup script:

```bash
./run-local.sh
```

This script does the following:

- sources `.envrc` if present
- exports `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` defaults
- starts Docker services for Postgres and Redis
- builds the backend and starts it on port `8787`
- starts the frontend on port `3000`

If the frontend or backend fails to start:

- make sure `docker`, `go`, and `pnpm` are installed
- make sure port `3000` is free
- make sure `.envrc` contains valid Auth0 and Reddit secrets for the portal login flow

### Codespaces-specific notes

If you open this repo in a new GitHub Codespace, do this before visiting the app:

```bash
gh codespace ports visibility 3000:public 8787:public
```

Then open the public Codespaces app URL for port `3000`, for example:

```text
https://<your-codespace-id>-3000.app.github.dev/auth/login
```

The frontend already supports runtime fallback for the Codespaces API URL in:

- `frontend/portal/src/services/grpc.ts`
- `frontend/portal/src/services/config.ts`

So if ports `3000` and `8787` are public, the frontend will resolve the backend automatically.

### If you want to avoid repeating the same errors

Always start from the repo root and use:

```bash
./run-local.sh
```

If you need the exact file set for another AI or a new collaborator, point them here first:

- `.envrc.example` — required environment variables and local defaults
- `run-local.sh` — the full local startup flow
- `frontend/portal/src/services/grpc.ts` — API endpoint resolution logic
- `frontend/portal/src/services/config.ts` — portal and API URL configuration
- `frontend/portal/src/components/pages/Login.tsx` — OTP login UI and flow
- `backend/portal/handler_portal_passwordless_start.go` — passwordless start handler
- `backend/portal/handler_portal_passwordless_verify.go` — passwordless verify handler
- `backend/browser_automation/reddit.go` — cookie-based Reddit login and cookie extraction flow

If a new AI is taking over the repo, tell it:

- "Run `./run-local.sh` from the repo root after copying `.envrc.example` to `.envrc` and setting secrets."
- "In Codespaces, expose ports `3000` and `8787` publicly."
- "Check `frontend/portal/src/services/grpc.ts` for runtime API resolution."
- "Check `backend/portal/handler_portal_passwordless_start.go` and `...verify.go` for the OTP login route."

---

## Syncing Changes

- **Commit local changes:**

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: clarify Steel requirement and add sync instructions" || echo "no changes to commit"
```

- **Push to GitHub:**

```bash
git push origin main
```

Ensure you have push permissions and your Git credentials set up (SSH key or `gh auth login`).

## ☁️ Deployment

- Hosted on **Railway.app**
- GCP used for LLM and Playwright storage
- Secrets managed via **GCP KMS**
- PostgreSQL and Redis hosted on Railway

---

## 🛡️ Account Safety Strategies

To minimize Reddit account bans:

1. **Age-based limits** — automate only with accounts > 2 weeks old
2. **Gradual scaling** — increase activity slowly
3. **DM-first approach** — DMs are safer than comments
4. **Rule adherence** — generate context-aware replies
5. **Consistent engagement** — reply and post regularly
6. **Occasional posting** — maintain activity score

---

## ⚠️ Gotchas & TODOs

- We currently use OpenAI for keyword/subreddit suggestions during onboarding and LiteLLM for other AI related tasks. Ideally, we should use a single AI provider for all tasks.
- When scoring a post, if the score is >90, we double check it with an advance model. This could be improved by selecting a better default model.
- Comment and DM generation should be moved into separate LLM calls. Right now, scoring, comment and DM generation are all done in a single LLM call.
- We should add the ability to regenerate comments or DMs.
- To avoid getting banned, we only use Reddit accounts that are > 2 weeks old for AI generation. This is a temporary solution and we should come up with a better way to handle account warmup.
